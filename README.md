#Invest City APP
An app for an investment-themed game in the style of Monopoly, designed to teach simple and compound interest in a didactic and fun way. The app would be managed by a banker who would handle all banking transactions between players' accounts, draw chance or setback cards, and pose questions about simple and compound interest. The app includes game instructions as well as a section with information about the application. A feature currently in development is the use of NFC technology cards to enable transfers between players â€” similar to a debit card machine on a mobile phone.
